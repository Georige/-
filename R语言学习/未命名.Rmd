This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = c()
x
length(x)
1:length(x)
"+"(2,3)
seq(from = 12, to = 30, by = 5)
x = NULL
length(x)
seq(x)
?base

```



```{r}
findruns = function(x,k){
  run = NULL
  for (i in 1:(length(x) - k + 1)) {
    if (all(x[i:(i+k-1)] == 1)) run = c(run,i) 
  }
  return(run)
}

t = c(0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1)
findruns(t,3)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
